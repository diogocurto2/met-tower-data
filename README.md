# met-tower-data

1) Meteorological (met) towers are used to collect onsite data for resource assessment.  Anemometers and wind vanes are installed on the tower at various heights and boom orientations. Ten-minute data is collected for each sensor including the minimum, maximum,  average, and standard deviation over the ten-minute interval. Provide a proposed C#  class/struct architecture design that would hold all metadata and data for wind speed and wind direction sensors on a met tower. 
2) Using your class/struct design, write a function in C# that calculates and returns the average wind speed over a specified time period.  
3) Using your class/struct design, write a function in C# that calculates and returns the average wind shear power law exponent. 
4) MySQL databases are used to store met tower data among other datasets at ArcVera. Present a  proposed MySQL database table structure that would hold the met tower metadata and data that are used in the above C# code.
